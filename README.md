# Final-Project
I am going to create a Git repository that will contain all the source code and dependencies that I will use for each of the classes. I will use Git Bash to update my repository with several commits. For the first class named Address, I will include fields such as:
1. int streetNo: the street number
2. String street: the street name
3. String city: the name of city
4. String province: The name of province
5. String postalCode: The postal code
6. String country: The country
